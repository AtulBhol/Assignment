    "A1. In python, we add comments to out code, to provide explanations, notes or context about what we are coding. Comments are not executed by the python interpreter, they are purely for human readers to understand the code better.\n",
    "\n",
    "As per my findings, there are two-types of comments in python:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.Single-line comments: These are comments that are single line and typically used for short explanations or notes. These are indicated by the '#' symbol.\n",

    "    #I am assigning my varible with a value\n",

    "    2.Multi-line commments or Docstring: These are used for longer explanations function and a class documentation or docstrings. While python doesn't have a specific syntax for multi-line comments, use triple-quotes like ' ''' ' or ' \" \" \" ' is to create multi-line strings.\n",
